#OPX Logging

Logging APIs for OPX project.

##Description

This repo contains logging utilities for OPX project. The logging utilities provide a simple wrapper for syslog allowing the addition of things like line number and other details.
There is a CLI that will allow runtime modification of logging levels as well, called opx_logging_cli.
All headers are located in opx and will be installed in the /usr/include/opx folder (based on your prefix).
